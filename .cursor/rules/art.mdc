# Iron rules
- Always use Context7
- Always run tests after edits
- Never remove tests
- Always explain you thoughts, step-by-step, before suggesting edits
- Ask us first when you need to make edits in unopened files
- Ask us very explicitly that you are installing new tools
- Keep changes localized and minimum
- Keep variable names short, DO NOT name something like fooDataUpdaterAdapter

# About this project
line-fact-check is an app for submitting and flagging fake news.
It is a monorepo, and each directory at root can be treated as separate projects.
For example, @/factcheck/ is Go monolith HTTP API server, while @/backoffice-webapp is the web frontend.

# Nix use
The monorepo is also a Nix flake. This is done to ensure stuff builds at all times.

# CICD
The Git repository is hosted on GitHub and we use GitHub Actions for CICD.
We try to use Nix everywhere when we could, for example, in @.github/workflows/release.yaml.

# Jargons (in code and chat)
- A Go integration test is called "it-test"
