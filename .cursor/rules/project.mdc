# Iron rules
- Always use Context7
- Always run tests after edits
- Never remove tests
- Always explain you thoughts, step-by-step, before suggesting edits
- Ask us first when you need to make edits in unopened files
- Ask us very explicitly that you are installing new tools
- Keep changes localized and minimum
- Keep variable names short, DO NOT name something like fooDataUpdaterAdapter
- If your decisions used reference to links from forums or documentations, give us the URLs (without previewing it)

# About this project
line-fact-check is an app for submitting and flagging fake news.
It is a monorepo, and each directory at root can be treated as separate projects.
For example, [factcheck](/factcheck/) is Go monolith HTTP API server, while [backoffice-webapp](/backoffice-webapp/) is the web frontend.

# Nix use
The monorepo is also a Nix flake. This is done to ensure stuff builds at all times.

# CICD
The Git repository is hosted on GitHub and we use GitHub Actions for CICD.
We try to use Nix everywhere when we could, for example, in [.github/workflows/release.yaml](/.github/workflows/release.yaml)

# Jargons (in code and chat)
- A Go integration test is called "it-test", and Go integration tests end with `_it_test.go` and tag `integration_test`.
