# General Code Style & Formatting

- Follow the Airbnb Style Guide for code formatting.
- Use PascalCase for React component file names (e.g., UserCard.tsx, not user-card.tsx).
- Prefer named exports for components.
- Use function declarations for component-internal functions (avoid arrow functions inside components).

# Styling & UI

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use Shadcn UI for components.

# Data Fetching & Forms

- Use TanStack Query (react-query) for frontend data fetching.
- Use React Hook Form for form handling.
- Use Zod for validation.

# State Management & Logic

- Use React Context for state management.

# Testing

- Use Vitest for unit and integration testing.
- Place test files in the same directory as the code being tested.
- Name test files with the pattern `filename.spec.ts` (or `.tsx` for React components).
- Use describe, it, and expect in clear and consistent format.
- Mock external dependencies appropriately using vi.fn() and vi.mock().
- Prefer testing behavior over implementation details.
