# About factcheck

factcheck is the monolith HTTP backend for "fact-checking app".
HTTP server routing is composed with go-chi to keep dependencies to minimum.

# Code generation

> Because we use Go workspace, sometimes `go generate` might complain if we omit `-mod-mod` flag.

The following code generation tools are used:

- sqlc for database interactions, see [sqlc.yaml](/factcheck/sqlc.yaml) and [/data/](/factcheck/data)

- wire for dependency injection, lives inside [internal/di](/factcheck/cmd/api/di)
